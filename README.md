# Financial Econometrics Project - ML estimation of APARCH(1,1) model 

This is the Financial Econometrics project of Euan Dowers, Veronika Kyuchukova, Angus McKay and Laura Roman, completed as part of the Masters in Data Science at the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics. 

This project entails maximum likelihood estimation of an APARCH(1,1) model. 

The files in this GitHub repo include:

A report on the model and algorithm in the file explanation.pdf \
A function that maximises log-likelihood using a for loop in R (aparch.R) \
A function that maximises log-likelihood using a for loop in C (aparchC.R) \
A demo of the program in action
